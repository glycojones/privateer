/* This version of `getopt' appears to the caller like standard Unix `getopt'
   but it behaves differently for the user, since it allows the user
   to intersperse the options with the other arguments.

   As `getopt' works, it permutes the elements of `argv' so that,
   when it is done, all the options precede everything else.  Thus
   all application programs are extended to handle flexible argument order.

   Setting the environment variable _POSIX_OPTION_ORDER disables permutation.
   Then the behavior is completely standard.

   GNU application programs can use a third alternative mode in which
   they can distinguish the relative order of options and other arguments.  */

/* Describe the part of ARGV that contains non-options that have
   been skipped.  `first_nonopt' is the index in ARGV of the first of them;
   `last_nonopt' is the index after the last of them.  */

static int first_nonopt;
static int last_nonopt;

/* Exchange two adjacent subsequences of ARGV.
   One subsequence is elements [first_nonopt,last_nonopt)
    which contains all the non-options that have been skipped so far.
   The other is elements [last_nonopt,optind), which contains all
    the options processed since those non-options were skipped.

   `first_nonopt' and `last_nonopt' are relocated so that they describe
    the new indices of the non-options in ARGV after they are moved.  */

static void exchange (char **argv);

/* Scan elements of ARGV (whose length is ARGC) for option characters
   given in OPTSTRING.

   If an element of ARGV starts with '-', and is not exactly "-" or "--",
   then it is an option element.  The characters of this element
   (aside from the initial '-') are option characters.  If `getopt'
   is called repeatedly, it returns successively each of theoption characters
   from each of the option elements.

   If `getopt' finds another option character, it returns that character,
   updating `optind' and `nextchar' so that the next call to `getopt' can
   resume the scan with the following option character or ARGV-element.

   If there are no more option characters, `getopt' returns `EOF'.
   Then `optind' is the index in ARGV of the first ARGV-element
   that is not an option.  (The ARGV-elements have been permuted
   so that those that are not options now come last.)

   OPTSTRING is a string containing the legitimate option characters.
   A colon in OPTSTRING means that the previous character is an option
   that wants an argument.  The argument is taken from the rest of the
   current ARGV-element, or from the following ARGV-element,
   and returned in `optarg'.

   If an option character is seen that is not listed in OPTSTRING,
   return '?' after printing an error message.  If you set `opterr' to
   zero, the error message is suppressed but we still return '?'.

   If a char in OPTSTRING is followed by a colon, that means it wants an arg,
   so the following text in the same ARGV-element, or the text of the following
   ARGV-element, is returned in `optarg.  Two colons mean an option that
   wants an optional arg; if there is text in the current ARGV-element,
   it is returned in `optarg'.

   If OPTSTRING starts with `-', it requests a different method of handling the
   non-option ARGV-elements.  See the comments about RETURN_IN_ORDER, above.  */
